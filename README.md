# 🏨 Hotel Booking Analysis

This project analyzes hotel booking data from a **city hotel** and a **resort hotel**, including details such as bookings, cancellations, guest demographics, length of stay, and other booking-related information.  
The goal is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify key trends and provide insights that can help hotels optimize operations and increase revenue.

- **Data size:** 119,390 rows × 32 columns  
- **Key details:** bookings, cancellations, stay duration, guests, meals, room types, deposit types, customer types, agents, and more.  
- **Objective:** Understand hotel booking patterns, analyze cancellation behavior, and derive insights to improve hotel revenue strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Notebook:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source URL:** [Hotel Booking Demand Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand)  
- Includes booking information for both hotel types with guest details, length of stay, deposit types, meal preferences, and more.

## 🔧 Data Cleaning & Preparation
- **Handling Missing Values**
  - Replaced missing values in `company` and `agent` with 0  
  - Filled missing `country` values with `"others"`  
  - Filled missing `children` values with column mean  

- **Removing Duplicates**
  - Dropped duplicate rows to ensure data quality  

- **Data Type Corrections**
  - Converted `children`, `company`, and `agent` columns to integers  

- **Feature Engineering**
  - Created `Total_stay = weekday_nights + weekend_nights`  
  - Created `Total_members = adults + children + babies`  

- **Outlier Handling**
  - Removed extreme values in `average_daily_rate (adr)`

## ✅ Key Insights
- City Hotel accounts for ~61% of bookings, making it busier than Resort Hotel  
- July–August are the busiest and most profitable months  
- Bed & Breakfast (BB) is the most popular meal type  
- Most guests are from European countries, especially Portugal  
- Agent 9 handled the maximum bookings  
- Room Type A is most demanded, while Types H, G, and C generate higher ADR  
- Average stay is less than 4 days; City Hotel is preferred for short stays, Resort Hotel for longer stays  
- TA/TO channel is the most used booking channel  
- Cancellation rates are higher in City Hotel; long lead times increase cancellation probability  
- Repeat guests are very few → retention rate is low  
- Couples (two adults) form the majority of bookings

## ⚡ Challenges
- Large number of missing values  
- Presence of duplicate data  
- Incorrect data types in some columns  
- Choosing the most effective visualization methods  

---

## 📌 Conclusion
- City Hotel is busier and generates slightly more revenue than Resort Hotel  
- Hotels should focus on **Room Types A and H** to balance demand and profitability  
- Marketing efforts should target **peak months (May–August)** for maximum revenue  
- Retention strategies are needed, as repeat customer rates are very low  
- Offering **couple-focused packages** can increase satisfaction and revenue  
- Long-stay customers could be given **discounts**, since longer stays usually reduce ADR
